driver.py: The driver file that creates a KMeans object and runs the algorithm. This contains the main method,
            event loops and user interaction handling.

kmeans.py: This is the main implementation file that contains all the methods used to process the user input data
           and apply the kmeans algorithm on the data when the program is running.
            This is imported into the driver file to provide results to the driver.
